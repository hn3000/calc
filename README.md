# A simple pocket calculator built with HTML, CSS grid and javascript

Annoyed by the lack of a calculator app on iOS and a plethora of 
advertisement-filled calculator-apps and -websites I decided to
build the simplest and smallest calculator I could.

The only extra is the DSEG14 font that gives the classic 14-segment
display look to the calculator's output area.
